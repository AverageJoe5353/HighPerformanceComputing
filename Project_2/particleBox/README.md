# Particles in a Box!
This simulation uses Langevin dynamics to simulate a bunch of particles in a box with reflecting boundary conditions. 

# Usage
1. run the program :)


# Methods

## Simulation
A simulation time-step essentially consists of two phases: `interaction` and `reaction`.

- The `interaction` phase handles all of a particle's interactions with the system including wall and particle collisions.

- The `reaction` phase is essentially just the movement phase which is the *reaction* to the forces computed in the previous phase. 


### Langevin Dynamics

### Reflecting Boundary Conditions

### Particle-Particle Interaction


## Optimizations

### Spatial Hashing for Neighbour Lookup

### Parallelization Across Particles
